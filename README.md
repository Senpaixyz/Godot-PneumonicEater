Pneumonic Eater is a 2D game which focuses on a plague that infects cell protein in human respiratory cells. The player is the virus character of the game and the white blood cells are the opponent of the player.
The game starts with a virus that are looking for a healthy tissue and infects the cell protein. After it successfully contaminates the cell proteins, the virus will double its amount. The player needs to avoid the white blood cells that spread to the human respiratory system. When the single virus and white blood cell collides, the white blood cell will win and the virus will be destroyed. Therefore, in order to win the game, the player has to avoid the white blood cells as much as possible or the entire respiratory system will be destroyed. The number of white blood cells that the human respiratory system has depends on the level of the game which means that the game will start to an unhealthy respiratory system and weak immune system (level one). Every time the human cells in respiratory system decrease the number of virus, it will decrease its amount as well. 
The scoring system depends on how many viruses are destroyed by the cells. The score will drop when the white blood cells destroys every single virus that the player has. One (1) cell is equivalent to ten (10) threat cell protein coin. 
This will challenge the playerâ€™s strategic, critical thinking, memory and problem solving skills as well as their eye-hand coordination. The theme of the game mainly focuses on having a child-friendly environment including simple controls and creative interface in order for the players to enjoy the game.
